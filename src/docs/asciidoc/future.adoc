Kotlin quite simple, just replaces java with kotin
node in beta stage .net in beta stage
Quarkus/Micronaut in proof of concept phase working together with the micronaut team
Boot 2.2 is in master, took a little longer due to spring cloud
Worked together with michael simons from the neo team, waiting SDN/RX release to get a merge request
Modulith for better structure, Reactive with reactor but I could imagine a vert.x blueprint, 
Micro Frontents will be great if we get it right as it is hard to make it good

Modulith -> Better package/module structure, instead by layer by domain
