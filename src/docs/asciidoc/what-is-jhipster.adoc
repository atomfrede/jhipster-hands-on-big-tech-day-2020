We have Vue.js, which I would prefer, but we will show Angular this time

=== What is JHipster?

[quote]
icon:quote-left[2x] TL,DR; JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop, & deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures. 

[NOTE.speaker]
--
We started as a very small code generator, as of now we have evolved to a platform which can be leveraged 
for all phases of a project. Other OSS projects are coming to us as they would like to integrate 
in order NOT to have a hello world example...

=== Goals

[quote]
icon:quote-left[2x] A high-performance and robust server-side stack with excellent test coverage
[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] A sleek, modern, mobile-first UI with Angular, React, or Vue + Bootstrap for CSS
[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] A powerful workflow to build your application with Webpack and Maven or Gradle
[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] A resilient microservice architecture with cloud native principles in mind

[NOTE.speaker]
--
In particular the workflow is very important. We try to ease development and make the pain go away
when it comes to e.g. configuration of webpack + maven

=== Policies

[quote]
icon:quote-left[2x] technologies used by JHipster have their default configuration used as much as possible

[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] only add options when there is sufficient added-value in the generated code

[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] for the Java code, follow the default Intellij IDEA coding style*

[quote.fragment]
icon:quote-left[2x] use strict versions for third-party libraries

[NOTE.speaker]
--
For example, we use JPA, Spring, Angular and React the “usual way”, without some heavy configuration options and with their usual naming and coding conventions. We do this as:

Each technology usually has a very good reason to have those defaults
It’s much easier to understand how JHipster works if we don’t re-configure everything

We might only change a default configuration if it produces some issue with the other technologies used by JHipster. For example, to have Spring Security and Angular working together, we had to change Spring Security’s default configuration.

Speaking about formatting...
Wie ist das in der JS welt? macht man sich da noch Gedanken uber formatting?

Well eher nicht, dank prettier. Bald auch in einem Java Projekt bei euch um die Ecke...

Not yet final, but already useable, but of course opionated, but thats what prettier is doing
--> No discussion about formatting anymore
